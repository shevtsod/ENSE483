# ENSE 483 - Project - Pig Farm Management IoT System

This system implements **Meat UC5.1: Pig Farm Management** as specified in the
_Internet of Food & Farm 2020 Use Case Architectures and Overview of the Related
IoT Systems_ document. This system automates management of pig farms using
sensors that report various parameters of each pigâ€™s health to supply decision
makers such as farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and experts with relevant and
actionable information.

## Requirements

- Docker Engine [1.13.0+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/)

## Usage

To deploy in production (i.e., on a Raspberry Pi device):

```shell
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

> **NOTE:**
>
> The `docker-compose.prod.yml` file contains overrides specific to Raspberry Pi
> devices. For example, a different MariaDB image is specified as the official
> image does not support the Raspberry Pi/ARMHF architecture.

## Environment Variables

### `DB_PASSWORD`

**Required**. Password for the user account with read/write permissions that is
created in each database used by the system.

## Developing

To develop locally:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```
