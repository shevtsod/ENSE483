# ENSE 483 - Project - Pig Farm Management IoT System

This system implements **Meat UC5.1: Pig Farm Management** as specified in the
_Internet of Food & Farm 2020 Use Case Architectures and Overview of the Related
IoT Systems_ document. This system automates management of pig farms using
sensors that report various parameters of each pigâ€™s health to supply decision
makers such as farmers, slaughterhouse workers, and experts with relevant and
actionable information.

## Requirements

- Docker Engine [1.13.0+](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/)

## Usage

To deploy in production (i.e., on a Raspberry Pi device):

```shell
# Set environment variables (can also be done via a .env file)
export NODE_ENV="production"
export DB_PASSWORD="my_password"
export SECRET_KEY="my_secret"

# Start services
docker-compose up

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

## Environment Variables

### `DB_PASSWORD`

**Required.** Password for the user account with read/write permissions that is
created in each database used by the system.

## Developing

To develop locally:

```shell
# Set environment variables (can also be done via a .env file)
export DB_PASSWORD="my_password"
export SECRET_KEY="my_secret"

# Start services
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
  -f docker-compose.test-sensors.yml \
  up -d --build

# Stop services
docker-compose \
  -f docker-compose.yml \
  -f docker-compose.dev.yml \
  -f docker-compose.test-sensors.yml \
  down -v
```

> **NOTE:**
>
> The `docker-compose.dev.yml` file contains overrides specific to the
> development environment. Modifications include building certain images locally
> and selecting different variants of third-party images.
